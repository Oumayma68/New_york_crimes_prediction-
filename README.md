#  Analysis and prediction of crimes in New York City using a machine learning approach and spatiotemporal data 
Our objective is to predict the types of crimes that a person may suffer based on specific data such as age, gender, location etc... using machine learning models.
We have also developed a web application that helps our users to enter specific data to display as a result the most likely type of crime that will be committed against
him.
We went through different steps and made use of different techniques to realize this solution :
Explore and clean data
Model selection and testing
Web interface development
